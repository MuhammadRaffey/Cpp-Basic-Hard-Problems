# Real-Life Scenario-Based Problems in C++

### Problem 1

**Scenario:** You are developing a simple banking application. Write a program that allows the user to enter their current balance and then perform deposits and withdrawals. The program should keep running until the user chooses to exit and should show the updated balance after each transaction.

### Problem 2

**Scenario:** You are creating a basic calculator. Write a program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, \*, /) as input from the user and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. Handle division by zero appropriately.

### Problem 3

**Scenario:** You are building a grading system for a school. Write a program that takes the marks of five subjects as input from a student and calculates the average. Based on the average, assign a grade (A, B, C, D, or F).

### Problem 4

**Scenario:** You are developing a library management system. Write a program that keeps track of books. Allow the user to add a new book (with a unique ID, title, and author), search for a book by its ID, and display all books in the library.

### Problem 5

**Scenario:** You are building a simple inventory management system for a store. Write a program that allows the user to add items with their quantities and prices, update item quantities, and calculate the total value of the inventory.

### Problem 6

**Scenario:** You are creating a movie ticket booking system. Write a program that allows the user to select a movie from a list, choose the number of tickets, and calculate the total cost. Each movie has a different ticket price.

### Problem 7

**Scenario:** You are developing a temperature monitoring system for a greenhouse. Write a program that takes the temperature readings for a week (7 days) as input and calculates the average temperature. If the average temperature is outside a specified range, display a warning message.

### Problem 8

**Scenario:** You are creating a basic contact management system. Write a program that allows the user to add, search, and delete contacts. Each contact should have a name and a phone number.

### Problem 9

**Scenario:** You are developing a voting system for a small election. Write a program that allows users to vote for candidates. Each candidate has a unique ID. At the end of the voting period, the program should display the total votes for each candidate and the winner.

### Problem 10

**Scenario:** You are building a budget tracker. Write a program that allows the user to enter their monthly income and expenses (rent, groceries, utilities, etc.). The program should calculate the remaining balance and suggest if they are overspending based on a given threshold.
